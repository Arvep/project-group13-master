            Related to the team task "How might we communicate the actions each citizen should take to stop the virus
            from
            spreading?" The team explored the problem space. Within this problem space the team identified 3 major
            topics:
            First of all, the team identified an information overload for the citizens in different dimensions. The
            citizens
            receive several different information from numerous sources and are overwhelmed by the information.
            Secondly, the team concluded that there are visualisation issues - especially regarding the spread of the
            disease and the background of applied safety measures.
            Thirdly, the team determined confusion about local measures as a major setback about the communication. The
            citizens don't know which measures are valid in their area.
            In conclusion, we developed a detailed problem space with interconnected topics, in which we want to find
            the
            sweet spot for a solution.

        <div className="row mt-2 font-weight-bold">Solution Pitch</div>
        <div className=" page bg-light row mt-1">
            The current pandemic creates a storm of never ending breaking news and alaming headlines, which establish a
            feeling of unease and nervosity among citizens. Our "Covid - Master" platform answers these feelings by a
            one -
            stop solution for everyone craving after trustworthy information related to the personal situation. Within
            our
            platform the user gains easy access to straightforward information about the current precautionary measures,
            local regulations and relevant health information. Therefore the user leaves the platform fully informed
            without
            any feeling of anxiety or worryness to go well through these challenging times.</div>
        <div className="row mt-2 font-weight-bold">The solution</div>
        <div className="page bg-light row mt-1">
            Our brainstorming uncovered three problems to be solved: Information overload, Visualization Issues,
            Confusion
            about local measures. Excited to propose a proper solution for those problems, the team immediately agreed
            on
            developing a website that offers reliable information (from reliable sources, e.g., WHO) in a comprehensive
            form. The Covid-Master is the result of this team work. While keeping the experience of the user in mind,
            the
            prototype of the website was designed using Figma and finally implemented with Bootstrap. Content of the
            website
            ranges from information about measures in Germany and why they are important, over current infection numbers
            in
            the different federal states and differences in measures in the different states (e.g., different contact
            regulations), to a symptoms' quiz which gives a first assessment of whether it might be possible that the
            user
            suffers from Covid-19. Overall the Covid-master aimed at providing personally relevant information in these
            somewhat unsettling times. The website is not yet fully functioning. However, it could be used as a template
            for
            further work.</div>
        <div className="row mt-2 font-weight-bold">Impact on the crisis</div>
        <div className="page bg-light row mt-1">
            The Corona-crisis is marked by a high level of uncertainty. Usually, scientists, governments and other
            organizations aim and succeed at reducing this uncertainty. However, right now there is a huge number of
            sources
            which can be used to gain information. The problem with this variety of sources is that they offer different
            "facts" - sometimes even contradicting "facts". Thus, the question arises where to look for reliable
            information
            which is personally relevant. The Covid-Master detected this problem. By gathering scientific and
            governmental
            information (e.g., about the importance of face masks) and breaking it down into comprehensible parts, the
            website counteracts "alternative facts" and helps reduce uncertainty. For example, there are many different
            measures in the states of Germany. In order to work out what current behavioral regulations the Bavarian
            Government released, a quick glance at the Covid-Master suffices. The practical benefit of the Covid-Master
            in
            this diffuse situation is therefore quite prominent.
